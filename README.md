# Working with Express.js and MongoDB

This repository is part of a learning journey focused on building robust RESTful APIs using **Node.js**, **Express.js**, and **MongoDB**.  

Here, you'll find a hands-on implementation of key backend concepts including:

- Setting up a simple Express server
- Creating and managing REST API endpoints
- Connecting to MongoDB for data persistence
- Using middleware for logging, authentication, and error handling
- Modularizing code for maintainability
- Implementing CRUD operations for a product catalog

## What to Expect in This Repo

- **Structured source code** with proper folder separation for routes, middleware, and configuration  
- **In-memory and MongoDB-based product storage** (switchable for learning purposes)  
- **API key authentication** for secure access  
- **Centralized error handling** and informative responses  
- **Tools for testing API requests** (like Postman collection or cURL examples)

Whether you're exploring Express basics or looking to expand into full-stack JavaScript development with MongoDB, this repo is a solid place to start.
